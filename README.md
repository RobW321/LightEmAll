The game starts off with a grid of randomly configured wires which 
can be clicked to rotate them. The number of rows and columns of the grid 
can be adjusted through the arguments. Starting with the power station, wires can
be powered up by connecting them to adjacent pieces which have an opening.
Furthermore, the power station can be moved using the arrow keys but only
across connecting wires that are also powered. On the top right of the screen,
there is a click count which counts how many clicks it takes a player to 
fully connect and power all the wires. Once all wires are connected and powered,
a win message is displayed on the screen.
